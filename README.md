# Who are we

The **Genomics and biological information Systems group(GBIS)** at [Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netaji_Subhas_Institute_of_Technology) is a
attempt to create a research group in NSIT which aims to contribute to a very recent scientific development taking place in world.
Thus we aim to bring out better culture for research at NSIT by exploring the intersection of information technology and molecular-level
manipulation using in-silico and wet lab experiments.


# What does group wish

GBIS wishes to brings together faculty, students and later attract research scientists by industry collaboration 
with expertise in computer architecture, programming languages, security and cryptography,computational biology and machine learning,
synthetic biology, and biochemistry. There are people with diverse backgrounds in many teams 
across the globe trying to solve current state of the art research problem of making DNA storage commercial.
Shoot messages to any of members and they will introduce you to work we wish to do.

# Research interests

The current interests of the group are to use synthetic DNA for digital storage. There are multiple aspects and areas of 
problems to solve to make DNA storage commercial. Why are excited about storing information in DNA?
How many of us can read the floppy drives now? Its very hard to read them becuase the equipments available to read them are
hard to find now. We shift our storage medium iteratively copying the information. But no method of storage is currently 
long term.The current storage systems shall render themselves redundant soon.
So **what is the solution?**
DNA at its worst has a half life of over 500 years and DNA data from over 50k years of unattended fossils have been successfully
sequenced. 
With more than 90% of data being generated in past no matter how much horizontally we scale our servers data will increase 
exponentially. Therefore the solution to offer to such massive data storage crisis is to find a media that can store huge
amount of data in lot less space. Again we find DNA to be the answer.
